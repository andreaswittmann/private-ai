Style for GitHub Project Documentation

The tone should be clear, calm, and grounded, with a focus on practicality and traceability. The aim is to document what has been done, why it has been done this way, and how it works — without slipping into a personal or promotional tone. While not as emotional or reflective as the blog, the writing should still feel accessible and human, not overly formal or academic.

Use plain, direct language to explain setups, decisions, structures, and configurations. Keep a balance between technical precision and readability, avoiding jargon where possible and explaining key concepts where necessary.

The overall tone should reflect thoughtful craftsmanship: this is a working solution, built with care, grounded in experience, and open to improvement.

Characteristics:
	•	No personal pronouns (“I”, “we”) – let the code, structure, and decisions speak for themselves.
	•	Motivations and rationale are explained factually but without marketing language. “This was chosen because…” or “This setup avoids…” is fine; avoid “best practice” unless clearly qualified.
	•	Problems and limitations are not hidden. If something is a workaround or a compromise, say so.
	•	Structure and clarity are more important than verbosity. Avoid unnecessary flourishes.
	•	Consistent formatting for code blocks, command-line snippets, and configuration examples.
	•	Chronology and context (e.g. “Initially implemented with X, later changed to Y”) are welcome, especially in README or changelogs.

Example Phrasing:
	•	✅ “This repository contains a containerized deployment for WordPress with Traefik as reverse proxy.”
	•	✅ “The pipeline builds and pushes the Docker images before deploying to the staging environment.”
	•	✅ “Initially, NGINX was used as reverse proxy, but Traefik provided better support for dynamic routing in this context.”
	•	✅ “This setup works reliably on macOS and Linux; Windows support is untested.”
